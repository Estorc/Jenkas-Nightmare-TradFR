<h2>Conduit</h2>
<p>
Return to the Conduit to find a rocket platform in the middle of the path.
Stand on top of it and examine it, and you will fly up to a new area.
</p>
<h2>Egg Corridor</h2>
<p>
The Egg Corridor is broken up into a front and backside, each of which
are very similar to the other, with some minor aesthetic differences.
On the front, Basil, the white wisp enemy, will travel along the
bottom of the screen. On the backside, Basil will travel along the top
of the screen. Contact with Basil will kill you instantly.
</p>
<p>
From the entrance, head as far right as you can. Enter the door to reach
the backside.
</p>
<h2>Egg Corridor (Back)</h2>
<p>
Head back toward the left. When you reach the 'beginning' of the map,
there will be a gap in the ceiling, allowing you to travel up and back
to the right. Time your movement carefully to avoid the Basil.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the end of this sequence, you'll find a Save Room, with
its own passages between the front and backsides. Stay on the backside
for now, and continue travelling to the right until you find another door.
</p>
<h2>Egg Corridor</h2>
<p>
Head back to the left, and this time enter the bottom gap alongside Basil.
Head back to the right and time your jumps over the Basil until you reach
a small vent underneath the door you came from.
</p>
<h2>Egg Observation Room</h2>
<p>
Wait for the moving platform to move up a floor, then stand under it.
Jump up on the left side to coax the Press to fall down, then dodge out
of the way. When the platform comes back down, travel up the left side,
then destroy the blocks under the other Press to get it out of the way.
</p>
<p>
On the right side, fall down and quickly fly to the left to reach the
door back outside.
</p>
<h2>Egg Corridor</h2>
<p>
Head to the right, and be cautious of the spikes falling from the ceiling.
When you reach a vertical chasm, wait for the large spike to fall first
and destroy it before travelling up the gap. Continue to the right to
reach a Save Room and the door out of the area.
</p>
<h2>Egg 00</h2>
<p>
Head to the right. You'll feel a chill...
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Dragon Sisters</h3>
<p>
Wait for either sister to open its mouth, then attack it. If you wait too
long, the sister will spit fire at you.
</p>
<p>
After their health gets low enough, both sisters will open their mouths at
the same time and spit fire at you together. Try to lure their aim in such
a way that you can dodge more easily. Don't be afraid to head to the left
or right sides of the area so the fires are coming from the same direction!
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>Either dragon only needs to be shot in the
mouth twice to cancel their attack. Each time you do cancel their attacks,
they drift further and further out of sync with one another as you
prevent them from shooting at you. When they begin to attack together,
try to unload on one of them to end the fight as quickly as possible.</o>
</p>
<p>
After the fight, a new door will open on the right.
</p>
<h2>Outer Wall</h2>
<p>
Make your way up the wall, remaining cautious of the hopping enemies and
the Night Spirits. Any patches of sand on the way up will contain a Sand
Croc, so try to avoid contact with these traps, or keep moving to avoid
taking damage.
</p>
<p>
As you get closer to the top, the wall will curve into a ceiling, and
you'll have to do some tricky flying under and back onto the other side
of the overhang. Be very careful when doing this, as if you fall from
here it is impossible to save yourself without the &#9679MACHINE GUN&#9679.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the top, enter the door to reach <a href="B11.html">The Observatory.</a>
