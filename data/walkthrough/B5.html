<div class="page_title">Labyrinth's Labyrinth</div><br /><br />
<h2>Old Clinic</h2>
<p>
After waking up from previous events, speak with the blue robot to
give yourself a better idea of where you are and what to do.
Head outside.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth W</h2>
<p>
Head to the right and speak with the small cat. He'll force you into
looking for sone &#9679CRITTER JUICE&#9679, to power his machine. You'll
need to find some anyway, in order to leave the Labyrinth.
</p>
<p>
Backtrack to the Old Clinic, and instead fall down the gap and to
the right. Be wary of the moving blocks, getting crushed by one is
fatal.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth S</h2>
<p>
Head to the far right, then straight up. You can enter a pit-stop after
the corner on the right, but your destination is the top right corner
of the map.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth W</h2>
<p>
Head to the right, and enter the building.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth Shop</h2>
<p>
Head to the right and talk to Chaba, the Gaudi behind the counter.
He'll give you a key to a new area back in Labyrinth S. After the
conversation, you can head to the top floor of the building to
check the teleporter for another data card, and you're able to
use the computer to talk with Sue, and an old friend.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth W</h2>
<p>
Speak with the Cthulhu on the right a few times to receive a hint
for the upcoming puzzle area. Afterward, head back to the left and
return to Labyrinth S.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth S</h2>
<p>
Head to back to the bottom, and to the left. Fall down under the blocks,
and carefully jump across to the door on the bottom left.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth M</h2>
<p>
This area is a maze. The left and right doors loop you around a short
segment, and back to the same room in Labyrinth M. The lower door
seems to go elsewhere, at random.
</p>
<p>
The solution is as follows: <o>Looping once to the right will
continue forward to the next part of Labyrinth S. Looping to the left
will instead lead to a dead-end. Looping a second time in either
direction, or backwards a step, will lead back to the bottom of
Labyrinth S, where you started.</o>
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth S (Top)</h2>
<p>
After you find your way forward, you'll enter from the upper left
of Labyrinth S instead. Head to the lower right to find a pit-stop,
and the upper right to find a door leading back into the maze...
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth M</h2>
<p>
The final part of the riddle. What could it mean?
</p>
<p>
The solution is as follows: <o>Go back into the door you just
came from. The other two doors loop back to Labyrinth S or W.</o>
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth C</h2>
<p>
In this area, head to the right and follow any path you like to the
top corner, and then back to the left. You'll reach a large room,
and the boss of this area.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Great White Critter</h3>
<p>
Your target in this fight is the Great White Critter itself. It will
hop towards you, causing small dark green critters to fall from the
ceiling every time it lands.
</p>
<p>
Suto will join the critter in this fight, but you can't hurt him.
He will grab you on contact, and attempt to throw you INTO the
Great White Critter, so try to avoid contact with him.
</p>
<p>
If you get behind the Great White Critter, it will turn around and
begin spitting projectiles at you. When it does so, it becomes
vulnerable for a counter-attack, so use this as a chance to strike!
</p>
<p>
After it turns around three times, it will jump very high in the air,
and down will drop several small, and a few larger critters. The pattern
will then repeat.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>Wait for Suto to begin to approach you,
then jump over both him and the Great White Critter. Attack with whatever
weapons you have available, but be aware that it closes its mouth slightly
faster if struck by the &#9679MISSILE LAUNCHER&#9679. The &#9679BUBBLER&#9679
is a very useful weapon during the fight at Lv3, since it's capable of
simultaneously blocking shots and dealing damage by holding the button.</o>
</p>
<p>
A chest containing some &#9679CRITTER JUICE&#9679 will fall from the
ceiling. Backtrack through the maze until you reach the lower half of
Labyrinth S, then return to Labyrinth W.
</p>
<h2>Labyrinth W</h2>
<p>
Return to the small cat on the right, and give him the &#9679CRITTER JUICE&#9679.
Head to the right, and his large machine will whirr to life.
</p>
<p>
Hop on top of the right set of treads on the machine, and ride it across
the large bed of death spikes you couldn't cross before. Afterwards,
continue all the way to the right to reach the final stretch of the Labyrinth.
</p>
<h2>Revolutionarium</h2>
<p>
Make your way down the map, taking care in dealing with the Armoured
Gaudi as you go. Once you reach the bottom, you'll find a large room
with a chest, containing the &#9679ENERGY CELL&#9679 Booster wanted!
Oh, look, a boss.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Gaudskateers</h3>
<p>
Four large, armoured Gaudi will attack from either side. Only one
of these Gaudi will take damage at a time, and it's difficult to
pinpoint which one it is while they hop and shuffle about during
the fight.
</p>
<p>
After one of them goes down, another of the three will become vulnerable.
Figure out which one it is, defeat it, and repeat for the last two.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>The one on the far left is the first
one to be vulnerable. Regardless, your best bet is to try to lure
them all to one side of the arena, then spend the fight leaping and
flying over them all as they get close. This is another fight where
the Lv3 &#9679BUBBLER&#9679 is extremely effective, both defensively
and offensively, if you get close. Try to keep an eye on the life bar,
to see which Gaudi moves it, then break out the &#9679MISSILE LAUNCHER&#9679
when you get a clear shot at them.</o>
</p>
<p>
After defeating them all, head to the right and enter a small door.
You'll come across a familiar cave, where you can return to the Mimiga
Village.
</p>
<h2>Mimiga Village</h2>
<p>
Head to the Town Hall to meet with Curly, and she'll give you her &#9679AIR TANK&#9679,
allowing you to stay underwater as long as you want. Speak with Sue too,
and she'll get the teleporters functioning for you to return to Grasstown
and Sand Zone.
</p>
<p>
Your next goal is challenging and defeating Genesis and Oblivion.
There are two areas you can tackle to reach them in:
<a href="B6.html">The Aqueduct</a>, and <a href="B7.html">The Abandoned Facility.</a>
</p>
