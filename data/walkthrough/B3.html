<h2>Mimiga Village</h2>
<p>
You can head back to the Town Hall to find Sue, and she will explain
her desire to fix the teleporter system on the island. In order to
do so, she needs special data cards from the teleporters she'll
connect to.
</p>
<p>
The closest one, and next destination, is in Grasstown. Head to the
Reservoir to the left of the village and use the newly opened
valve to reach the door on the left.
</p>
<h2>Grasstown - Opening Area</h2>
<p>
Head to the large building on the right, and go inside. A Mimiga named
Jack will greet you and reiterate Sue's request for a data card, and
an idea on where to look for it. To head deeper into Grasstown, climb
the building and leave through the topmost door.
</p>
<p>
Once outside, climb up some more and head to the left. Examine the
console to turn on some fans in the opening area, and head back to the
right to reach a small building. As you approach, something inside
will hiss...
</p>
<h2>Teleporter Room</h2>
<p>
Someone, or something, seems to be messing with the teleporter.
If you approach them, or try to leave, they will notice you and
try to attack after a short conversation.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Suto</h3>
<p>
Suto will jump very high into the air, and try to land on you.
After landing, he'll shoot three balls of energy towards you,
then repeat the pattern.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>Stay a decent distance away, walk
over when he jumps, and jump over his projectiles after he
lands. It's also possible to bounce on his head, but it leaves
you open to his projectiles at close range.</o>
</p>
<p>
After the fight, head back to the building below and speak with
Jack again. He will ask you to head to an old storehouse on the
far side of Grasstown, and gives you a key to the Generator Room,
a medium-sized building to the right of the Teleporter Room.
</p>
<p>
After unlocking the door, examine the large computer on the right
to turn one some additional fans next to the Teleporter Room.
You will need to go back this way to reach an auxiliary power
console above the Generator Room.
</p>
<h2>Grasstown - Closing Area</h2>
<p>
After turning the auxiliary power on, head to the right to a series
of pillars. Under each pillar is a console that will turn the fans
on on its respective pillar, as well as the horizontal fans above it.
</p>
<p>
The sixth pillar's terminal is actually on a block half-way up it,
and requires climbing the previous pillars to reach it. There's also
a pesky ventilation fan on the top right that prevents you from
reaching the Old Storehouse...
</p>
<p>
The solution is as follows: <o>Turn on the first four pillars,
and leave the fifth one off for now. Climb the fans up to the top
of the fourth pillar, and reach a console above the left of it.
Use this console to turn the vents on the right off.
</o>
</p>
<p>
<o>Move over to the top of the fifth pillar, then fall down to the
console under the top of the sixth one. Turn this console on, then
drop down and turn the fifth one on now. Follow them all up to the
top to reach a Save Room and the Old Storehouse.</o>
</p>
<h2>Old Storehouse</h2>
<p>
Open the chest...
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Suto (#2)</h3>
<p>
Suto will flutter across the room before landing, and causes
several bouncing balls to spawn upon doing so. These can be
shot and broken to produce EXP or heath, but will take an
increasing number of hits to do so if your weapons level down.
</p>
<p>
After landing, Suto will shoot three balls of energy like he
did before, and then leap across the room again. There are also
some fans on either side of the building's ceiling that will
push you around if you try to jump over his projectiles.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>There are two distinct, but
viable methods in defeating Suto. The first is to stay on the
opposite side of the building as him and jump past him as he
flutters towards you, using the fan's momentum to your advantage.
This has the benefit of avoiding his projectiles more easily,
but it's difficult to hurt him efficiently outside of shooting
as you pass him.</o>
</p>
<p>
<o>The second method requires a quick trigger finger to avoid
damage. Instead of staying on the opposite end of the building,
move in closer before he jumps. He will flutter much slower as
he approaches you, leaving him open to easier-to-land damage.
You're much more open to being swarmed by the bouncing balls,
however.</o>
</p>
<p>
After his health gets low, Suto will stop fluttering mid-jump,
and instead land immediately, causing a much higher volume of
bouncing projectiles. He also won't clear the entire room in a
single jump, so use the extra space between you to your advantage.
</p>
<p>
After the battle ends, you're free to leave the room. Once you
leave, however, an earthquake rips the floor right out from under
you! You'll fall helplessly down to a new area, <a href="B4.html">The Underside.</a>
</p>
