<h2>Mimiga Village</h2>
<p>
There are several Mimiga you can speak with throughout the village to
catch-up on what's been happening to the island. One of them, Santa,
can be found at the bottom of the village, complaining about something
important.
</p>
<p>
If you enter the Mimiga Tower in the middle of the village, there is
a chest on the ground floor containing a &#9679MAGIC JOURNAL&#9679,
an item that will remind you of your current objective in the story
if you get lost, or forget when you last left off.
</p>
<p>
Another Mimiga, Kanpachi, can be found in the large building on the right.
He will give you a hint to explore Grasstown, but in order to reach it
you will have to switch on a valve in the village Pipeworks.
</p>
<p>
You can reach the Pipeworks through the door next to Santa.
</p>
<h2>Pipeworks S</h2>
<p>
Head to the right. Near the middle of the map is a small demonstration
of what to expect in this area - irrigation pipes. The pipe on the
ceiling near the end of the map can be used to quickly reach the entrance
to the area.
</p>
<h2>Pipeworks E</h2>
<p>
Make your way up through the first pipe. As you climb the map, you will
be presented with a series of pipes in groups of two - one will bring
you to the next floor, while the other will drop you back down.
</p>
<h2>Pipeworks N</h2>
<p>
This room will be a test of your jumping skills, in two halves.
Falling into the water below will transport you back to the start
of that half of the room.
</p>
<p>
The door in the middle of the room will lead to a Save Point,
while the door on the far left will continue to the valve you're
looking for.
</p>
<h2>Flow Control</h2>
<p>
Head to the right and examine the console to switch on the valve.
Suddenly...!
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Sue's Nightmare</h3>
<p>
Your primary target is a very large, angry Mimiga. It will walk
towards you and try to punch you. Step back or jump over it to
avoid taking damage.
</p>
<p>
Two other tall Mimiga-like creatures will try to attack from above,
as well. You will only take damage while they spin towards you, but
you can shoot them while they're spinning to stop the attack.
</p>
<p>
Once the large Mimiga's health gets low, it will instead back away
from you and open its mouth to shoot several balls of energy in a
random pattern. Get behind the Mimiga when it begins charging the
attack to completely avoid damage - but beware of its sucker-punch!
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>Fairly straightforward. Focus your
attacks on the large Mimiga until it gets close, then jump over it.
If you can, try to time the jumps in such a way as to avoid getting
hit by the other two Mimiga when they spin towards you.</o>
</p>
<p>
<o>If you picked up the &#9679SNAKE&#9679 earlier, try leveling it up
to Lv3 before the fight. If you do, you can stand very close to the
boss and let loose a barrage of very high damage. It's also effective
in being able to hit both of the spinning Mimiga at once, should you
want to stop them in their tracks.</o>
</p>
<p>
After the boss is defeated, a human-turned-Mimiga named Sue will appear.
Follow her out of the room, and you can now use a shortcut to return
to the <a href="B3.html">Mimiga Village.</a>
</p>
