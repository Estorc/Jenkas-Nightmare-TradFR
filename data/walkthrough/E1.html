<div class="page_title">Objets Secrets</div><br /><br />
<div class="advice">All secret items and the steps to attain them are listed below.</div>

<div class="col_frame">
<div class="page_subtitle">Excalibur</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc01"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
One of the earliest secrets in the game, &#9679EXCALIBUR&#9679 can illude many players
on their first playthrough. To reach it, search for the rightside-up Mimiga
Statue on the Underside, and examine it. A passage will appear, leading you
to a hidden area on the right. The hidden area is known as the Sanctuaire.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
There are two puzzles in the Sanctuaire. The first requires examining the
Mimiga statue graves in order from left to right. The second is a much more
complex 'Spirit Maze'. In this maze, a flame will follow your position around
the room, and try to trap you. It's possible to lure the flame by moving to a
position next to it.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc02"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc03"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
In the final room of the Sanctuaire, you will have to face off against an
old boss. It is, ironically, easiest to fight this boss by using the &#9679FIREBALL&#9679,
since it will trick it into a pattern of jumping more often, where it will be
easier to avoid its projectiles by moving left and right.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
If you fail to reach the Sanctuaire on your first trip to the Underside, it's
possible to get there again. Speak with Jack in Grasstown after returning from
the Labyrinth, then proceed through Grasstown until you reach the pit where you
originally fell down. A familiar ghost will coax you into following it...
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc04"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Crescent Medal</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc05"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
This is a test of skill. On your first trip to the Underside, proceed to the Sanctuaire
through the steps above, but DO NOT enter the door. Instead, touch the eye block to
the left of the door, and chase it back towards the left.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
Follow the block to the overhang area, then climb up and around to meet it on the other
side, rather than riding it. When you reach where the Cabane des Tréfonds is, ride the eye
block until you reach the farthest left it will go. Enter the hole behind a fence
near the start of the Underside to reach a hidden room with a chest.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc06"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Cat's Eye Medal</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc07"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
Defeat Monster X. This can be challenging depending on which weapons you have available
to you, however it's possible to return to the Labyrinth at a later time for a rematch.
Just make sure not to talk to him after winning, or he might steal the medal back.
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Afterburner</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
It's easy to forget, but after you finish the Labyrinth, head to Zone des Sables and give the
&#9679ENERGY CELL&#9679 to Booster. He'll reward you with the &#9679AFTERBURNER&#9679,
an item that triples the rate at which the &#9679SNAKE&#9679 regenerates ammo.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc08"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">The Spur</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc09"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
Any time after returning from the Labyrinth, visit the Gunsmith's house. He will be home
from his wandering around the island, and ready and able to create the &#9679SPUR&#9679 for you,
but you'll need the &#9679POLAR STAR&#9679 to do so. There isn't any information given beyond that,
but it's implied that the &#9679POLAR STAR&#9679 is still obtainable.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
After getting the &#9679BOOSTER v2.0&#9679, head to the Village Mimiga Cemetery and check the door
in the middle. Speak with the purple Pignon inside to start a fight for the &#9679POLAR STAR&#9679!
Knock out the green ones, then focus your damage on the purple one. Keep an eye on the
green ones, as they'll get back up as the fight goes on.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc10"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc11"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
Return to the Gunsmith's house with the &#9679POLAR STAR&#9679, and you'll find Suto. The fight with
him is broken up into two parts: first, he will jump around and throw missiles at you at
varying heights. Next, he'll act the same as he did in Grasstown. Defeat both his patterns,
and speak with the Gunsmith to obtain the &#9679SPUR&#9679.
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Whimsical Star</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
After both Genesis and Oblivion are defeated, you'll be forced to travel through the
Revolutionarium again. Proceed as normal, and check the newly filled chest in the middle
of the bottom room to find the &#9679WHIMSICAL STAR&#9679! You might get in a fight with the
Gaudskateers again, though.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc12"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Arms Barrier</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc13"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
After obtaining the &#9679MACHINE GUN&#9679, collect enough EXP to level it up to 3, and jump
down the pit on the far right of Grasstown. Break your fall by shooting the Machine
Gun downward, and fly over to the left of the pit to find the &#9679ARMS BARRIER&#9679.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
It's possible to get this as early as the first visit to Grasstown. After you turn the
Auxilery Power on, return all the way to the console on the far left of Grasstown and
turn it off. Hug the left wall while falling down the pit, and the three fans that pushed
you away will no longer be active.
</div><div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc14"></div>
</div></div></div>
<div class="page_subtitle">Nikumaru Counter</div><br />
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_cell"><div class="col sc15"></div></div>
<div class="col_text">
Make your way roughly half-way up the Paroi Extérieure, and keep an eye out for a rectangular
block with a picture of a clock on its face. Follow the 'stem' holding this block to the
wall, and examine the gap behind the stray railing to enter the Salle de l'Horloge.
</div></div></div>
<div class="col_table"><div class="table_row">
<div class="col_text">
The &#9679NIKUMARU COUNTER&#9679 can be found in the middle. It will enable a timer under special
circumstances near the very end of the game. Glory to all zealous challengers!
