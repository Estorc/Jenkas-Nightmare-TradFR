<h2>Balcony</h2>
<p>
Head all the way to the right. The house from earlier will serve as
a Save Room. You can also climb up the side of the palace on the far
right to find some hearts and several Experience Capsules, if you need
them. When you're ready, enter the palace.
</p>
<h2>Throne Room</h2>
<p>
Walk to the right to find Quote.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Red Quote</h3>
<p>
Quote will fly around and shoot orbs of energy in your direction before
teleporting around. If he teleports far enough away from you, three
floating orbs will float at his height and shoot lightning below them if
you pass under them.
</p>
<p>
As Quote takes damage, shield-like rings will spawn around him between
teleports. They will turn into red bats and fly towards you when he
teleports away again.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>You can walk or jump to avoid the flickering
orbs Quote shoots at you, and safely walk or fly under the lightning bolt orbs
before the lightning can actually hit you, as long as you keep moving.
When he puts his ring shields up, you'll have to time your attacks accordingly,
or jump inside the circle of rings and attack at close range.</o>
</p>
<p>
After the fight, a final Save Disk and Healing Station will appear.
Head to the right to enter the final stage of the game.
</p>
<h2>Arcadia F1</h2>
<p>
When you enter the room, your weapon levels will fall to 1 again.
Falling blocks will rain down from the ceiling here, and deal a lot
of damage if they land on you. There are also several Experience
Capsules in this room. It is difficult, but worth the effort,
to collect what you can.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the room the blocks will stop falling, and you
can fly up into the ceiling to reach the second area.
</p>
<h2>Arcadia F2</h2>
<p>
Head to the left. Butes will spawn from grates in the ceiling
and floor as your travel, and Deleet enemies will block your
path forward. At the end of the room you'll be assaulted by a
large army of Butes as you wait for the final two Deleets to
detonate.
</p>
<h2>Arcadia F3</h2>
<p>
Climb up, doing your best to avoid arrows and thrown blocks.
There will be more Experience capsules in this room to collect,
if you need them. At the very top is a boss.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Twin Ogres</h3>
<p>
Both enemies will behave the same as the White Devil, but at
differing intervals. It's much more difficult to avoid harm,
but there will be gaps between their attacks that you can use
to your advantage. Both ogres will need to be defeated to proceed.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>Both sets of attacks come at
roughly the same time, so you can treat this fight the same as
the White Devil. Attack whichever one you want, and once one
of them is defeated the battle is as good as won.</o>
</p>
<p>
A platform will appear in the middle of the room, letting you
enter the final door.
</p>
<h2>Terrace</h2>
<p>
Head to the right...
</p>
<h3>BOSS: The Doctor</h3>
<p>
The Doctor will throw a pair of orbiting balls of energy at you,
then teleport away. After roughly four of these, he'll instead
spawn in the air and fire a blast of energy in all directions.
</p>
<p>
All his energy shots, and his red crystal, will block your attacks.
You'll have to get close to him to deal any major damage.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Doctor's Wrath</h3>
<p>
In his hulking form the doctor will charge towards you, then up or
downwards, then towards you, before finally charging down or up into
the floor or ceiling. If he hits the ceiling, pieces of tile will
rain down on either side of him. If he hits the floor, shockwaves
and tiles will travel along the floor on either side of him until
they reach the walls.
</p>
<p>
After several attempts at attacking you this way, he'll instead
float into the air and rain lightning down onto you. Step out of
the way as the cursor comes to a halt to avoid these bolts of
lightning, and stay between cursors when he sweeps the screen
with them.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for these fights: <o>In the first fight, use the
floating crystal as a guide to where The Doctor has teleported to.
Follow it and try to get behind him before he attacks, then hit
him from behind before he can teleport away. If he sends orbs of
energy in all directions, stand directly below him to avoid taking
damage.</o>
</p>
<p>
<o>During the second fight, The Doctor won't charge towards you
until he takes some damage, so use this to your advantage in
avoiding the shockwaves or stray tiles. When he begins raining
lightning on your head, keep moving in one direction until it strikes,
then either turn around or keep moving to avoid the next one.</o>
</p>
<p>
He'll finally go down, but it's not over yet...
</p>
<h4>TRUE FINAL BOSS: TRISTITIA</h4>
<p>
During the fight, you will be suspended in the air and able to move
around in any direction.
</p>
<p>
Tristitia will circle around the map, accompanied with bat-like enemies
at the top and bottom of the area. Your targets in the first half of the
fight are the face-like balls that rotate around the boss. When enough
damage is done, the face will dim, and defeating all eight of them
will cause the boss to come to a stop in the middle of the room.
</p>
<p>
Tristitia will be now be accompanied by small spiked eyes rotating around
an outer layer, and it will summon several Butes to swarm around the room
and try to shoot you down. In this half of the fight, your target is
Tristitia itself. Once the health bar depletes, it's game over.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>During the first half, fly opposite Tristitia
to avoid taking damage. When it sweeps the room horizontally, there will be
enough of a gap between it and the bats to let you squeeze past it. Be
aware that you will turn around automatically as you cross certain points
on the map.</o>
</p>
<p>
<o>During the second half, try to stay just outside the outer circle of
spiked eyes, and destroy the active faced balls to clear a direct line
of fire to the boss itself. Staying low will help in avoiding contact
with the Butes or their arrows from either side.</o>
</p>
