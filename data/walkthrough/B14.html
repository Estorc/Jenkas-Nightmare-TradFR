<h2>Observatoire</h2>
<p>
You will now be playing as Curly. After a brief cutscene
with Kasuma and Booster, Balrog will give you the weapon
you left with him as Quote.
</p>
<p>
Use the teleporter. You will no longer be able to head to
the Balcon, but for now, head to Zone des Sables.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables?</h2>
<p>
Zone des Sables will have drastically changed. Head under the teleporter
to find an Experience Capsule to level up your current weapon, then
Head to the right through a series of challenges until you reach
Demeure de Misery.
</p>
<h2>Demeure de Misery?</h2>
<p>
Continue to the right.
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Draco Misery</h3>
<p>
Misery will leap and dash around in a slow, powerful manner. After
a few leaps and dashes, she'll teleport away and reappear above you
in an attempt to stomp you.
</p>
<p>
After a few teleports, she'll summon a large stream of red bats.
Slay them as quickly as possible, since they will bounce around
the room at high speeds and become difficult to avoid.
</p>
<p>
When she's finally defeated, a path on the right will open, allowing
you to enter the rest of Zone des Sables.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables?</h2>
<p>
Jumping will become more challenging, and it will be a long way until
the next Save Point. Climb up and head to the left until you reach a
fall downwards. There will be a large bed of sand with a Skeleton
enemy hopping around. This bed of sand, and several other patches
of sand, will all contain Sand Crocs, and you'll have to run and
jump constantly to avoid them all.
</p>
<p>
Next is a series of pillars and breakable blocks. If the weapon you
have lets you break these blocks, use it to your advantage as a
shortcut past this section. Be wary of the beds of sand towards
the end of this area, as well.
</p>
<p>
After the pillar section, there is a Save Disk on the lower path to
the right. Continue up and around on the upper path, which will arch
down into a series of sand beds full of even more Sand Crocs, and
several walking skull enemies. If your weapon is the &#9679FIREBALL&#9679,
it can be very useful in defeating these enemies without having to
challenge the Sand Crocs until the path is clear.
</p>
<p>
At the end of these beds of sand, head up and back to the left.
Here you'll finally reach Maison de Jenka.
</p>
<h2>Maison de Jenka</h2>
<p>
Check the sparkling patch on the floor to retrieve Quote's inventory,
including his &#9679BOOSTER v2.0&#9679. Open the menu to equip it.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables?</h2>
<p>
Head back to the right. The Sun Stones near Demeure de Misery will open,
and you'll be able to fly up and leave the area without much more
trouble. There will be several Experience Capsules to the right, if
you want to level up any of Quote's weapons.
</p>
<p>
After reaching the Teleporter out of Zone des Sables, head to the Observatoire
again, and return to Plantation.
</p>
<h2>Plantation</h2>
<p>
Head to the left until you reach the Zone de Repos. Booster and Itoh will
be outside with a rocket platform set up for you. Hop onto it and use
it to travel most of the way up Plantation. You'll have to climb the
rest of the way towards the top, but it's functionally the same as
the first time you did it.
</p>
<h2>Dernière Caverne (Cachée)</h2>
<p>
The Dernière Caverne will have been altered to be even more difficult than
before. The same rules apply as last time, with the addition of
stricter flight and fewer Experience Capsules along the way.
</p>
<p>
When you reach the top, be wary of your surroundings in the final room.
The red critters on the floor will distract you from several Press enemies
that line the ceiling slightly off screen. Carefully make your way to
the door to reach <a href="B15.html">The Épilogue.</a>
</p>
