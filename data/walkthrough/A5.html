<p>
"New Game Plus", referred to as "NG+" in certain parts of this
walkthrough, is a special way of playing through Jenka's Nightmare.
It can be used to acquire new weapons and items, depending on
your actions while playing through the original Cave Story.
</p>
<p>
To access NG+, you must first finish Cave Story through the
"True" ending, by reaching the <o>Sacred Grounds</o>. If you
save your game in the "Construction" before this location,
you'll be able to enter NG+ by copying your Profile.dat into
the same folder as Jenka's Nightmare. After Loading the game
from Jenka's Nightmare, proceed with the game as normal.
</p>
<p>
Various weapons in your possession will be turned into special
capsules, which can be opened by NPCs as the game goes on.
Various items can also be carried over, although some may
require having completed special events first.
</p>
<p>
Health upgrades carry over depending on how many were collected,
and which ones you got. When starting the game, the following
formula will be applied to the health you start with:
</p>
<div class="codebox">1 + [Number of Health Capsules Collected Found in Cave Story]</div><br />
<p>
There are 11 Capsules de vie in the original Cave Story, which
will yield a total of 12 health, if you collected them all.
If you missed any Capsules de vie in the original game, they
can be collected somewhere in Jenka's Nightmare instead. Doing
so will give you a greater advantage towards the end of the
game, at the risk of starting Jenka's Nightmare with only 1 HP.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, your relationship with the Ermite Armurier will differ
depending on whether or not you <o>returned his Polar Star</o>
in the original game. If you didn't, his attitude may be very
cold and untrusting...
