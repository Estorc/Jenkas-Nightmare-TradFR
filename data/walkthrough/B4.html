<h2>Les Tréfonds</h2>
<p>
After the fall, you'll crash into a platform and drop your weapons.
</p>
<p>
Carefully make your way to the right. When you reach a gap too large
to cross, some platforms will appear! Cross the gaps and make your
way to a small room, containing the &#9679FIREBALL&#9679.
</p>
<p>
Pick up the &#9679FIREBALL&#9679 and the room's exit will open.
Continue carefully to the right to find some moving blocks, and
additional pathways and platforms opening as you approach them.
Eventually, you'll reach a door surrounded in sand...
</p>
<h2>Vanne d'Érosion</h2>
<p>
Make your way up any path you like. Keep an eye out for the rolling
metal enemies and the paths they take, as they inflict a rather
hefty amount of damage on contact.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables</h2>
<p>
Head far to the right and climb up and back to the left. You'll
find a door with a picture of a wine glass next to it. Inside,
you'll run into Jenka's Puppies here. They'll leave and begin
operating some teleporters around Zone des Sables, allowing you to
navigate the map. Inside the chest is a Dog Whistle, which can
be used to reset all of the teleporters if you get lost.
</p>
<p>
Speak with Cthulhu a few times for a few hints about navigating
Zone des Sables. You can feed a puppy to have it change where the
teleporter points to, letting you visit two other locations.
</p>
<p>
There are three other locations around the outer reaches of Sand
Zone, and these are your eventual destinations. Messing with
the teleporters will eventually bring you to one of them, so
it's important to keep Cthulhu's hints in mind...
</p>
<p>
The solution is as follows: <o>Set two teleporters to one another,
then take the third to reach a new location. So at the start, set
'Mimiga' and 'Gaudi' to one another, then drop down the pit at the
bottom and feed the puppy to reactivate the 'Flower' teleporter.</o>
</p>
<p>
After solving the puzzle, you'll reach a teleporter entitled 'Booster'.
From here, head to the right to reach a small workshop.
</p>
<h2>Atelier</h2>
<p>
Nobody's home. On the table in the middle is a &#9679BOOSTER v0.8&#9679,
which will allow you to fly around, and opens up new possibilities in the
central teleporter puzzle.
</p>
<p>
You can also find various notes about the floating island and the
state it's in, around the workshop. The blackboard will also help
with better understanding how the teleporters in Zone des Sables work.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables</h2>
<p>
With the &#9679BOOSTER v0.8&#9679 available, <o>you can set 'Mimiga'
to 'Flower' and take 'Gaudi'</o>, which will allow you to reach
another external teleporter entitled 'Misery'.
</p>
<p>
From this destination, head all the way to the right. Be wary of
the flat patches of sand, as most of them will contain Sand Croc
enemies.
</p>
<h2>Demeure de Misery</h2>
<p>
Misery will greet you, and Booster as well. You will be told about
what has been going on, and given an idea of what you can do to
help. Booster needs a special &#9679ENERGY CELL&#9679 from the
Labyrinth to finish his &#9679BOOSTER v2.0&#9679 for you, and
Misery will clear the Sun Stones from your path. She'll simply
tell you the solution to the final external destination.
</p>
<h2>Zone des Sables</h2>
<p>
With the sun stones to the right of the 'Gaudi' teleporter now opened,
you're able to reach the 'Mimiga' teleporter from there. Falling down
past the sun stones, however, will lock you inside. Head to the right...
</p>
<h3>BOSS: Deconstructor</h3>
<p>
Deconstructor will float up and down on the right side of the room,
making it rather difficult to hit it, depending on your available
weapons. After a few moments, it will shoot a barrage of drills at
you.
</p>
<p>
There are also several smaller enemies that will bounce around the
room. Try to avoid attacking these enemies, as there are three
'fakes' that will summon even more of them to attack you, when hurt.
</p>
<p>
The strategy for this fight: <o>If you have the &#9679MISSILE LAUNCHER&#9679,
wait for Deconstructor to steady out a bit before unloading missiles
at its face. If you run out, or if you're limited to only the
&#9679FIREBALL&#9679, you'll have to jump up and fall back down to
force it to bob in such a way that you can bounce a fireball
down towards it. You could also attack the swarms of smaller enemies
for extra missiles, but it's very risky if you get assaulted
by one of the 'fakes'...</o>
</p>
<p>
Once Deconstructor is destroyed, mess with the teleporters some
more to reach the last destination, 'Labyrinth'. From here,
climb up to the door. You'll run into Balrog, and together
you'll reach <a href="B5.html">The Labyrinth.</a>
